IBM Data science professional certificate: Applied Data Science Capstone

In this repository you can find the capstone project for the IBM Data Science professional certificate in Coursera.

The goal of the project is to predict the severity of an a car accident given different features like weather condition, road status... etc. I will be useful to encourage safe driving, modify the initial route of a driver or even to motivate the cancelation of the trip if the probability to encounter a very severe accident is high.

The model is going to be created based on the Seattle, WA accidents record data frame provided by SPD. The dependent variable or the labeled dat is going to be `SEVERITY` referring to the severity of a given accident.

The data set can be found here: https://s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/cf-courses-data/CognitiveClass/DP0701EN/version-2/Data-Collisions.csv

See `Metadata.pdf` file for more information about the data set.
